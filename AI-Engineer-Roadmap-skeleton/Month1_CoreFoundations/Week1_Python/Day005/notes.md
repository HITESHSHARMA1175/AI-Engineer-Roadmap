# Day 5 â€“ Month1_CoreFoundations / Week1_Python

## âœ… What I Learned
- Today's focus was on Python Modules, which allow for code organization and reuse.

Standard Library: I learned how to import and use powerful modules that come built-in with Python, such as datetime, calendar, os, and webbrowser.

Creating Custom Modules: I practiced creating my own module by defining a function in a Python file and then importing that file into another script.

Module Path (sys.path): I learned the advanced concept of how Python finds modules and how to add new directories to its search path if needed.

## ðŸ”¨ What I Built
- I wrote a script that demonstrates how to use several standard library modules. I also created a custom find_index function and practiced importing it as if it were a separate module to find items in a list.

## ðŸ“‚ Code
- All the examples and code for today are located in the exercises.py file inside the Day005 folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Step
- Now that I understand how to use modules, the next logical step is to learn how to interact with the file system. For Day 6, the focus will be on File I/O (Input/Output)â€”reading from and writing to files.
