# Day 2 â€“ Month1_CoreFoundations / Week1_Python

## âœ… What I Learned
- Today's session was focused on Python's four primary data structures, which are essential for organizing and storing collections of data.



Lists: I learned that lists are ordered and mutable (changeable) collections. I practiced adding, removing, sorting, and accessing elements.

Tuples: I understood that tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.

Sets: I explored sets, which are unordered collections that only store unique elements, automatically removing any duplicates.

Dictionaries: I learned how to work with key-value pairs to store data. I practiced accessing data using keys and iterating through the dictionary's items.

## ðŸ”¨ What I Built
- I created a comprehensive Python script that serves as a practical cheatsheet for all four data structures. It includes examples of their most common operations and methods.

## ðŸ“‚ Code
- All the code and examples for today's session are located in the exercises.py file inside the Day002 folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Step
- Now that I know how to store data, my next goal is to learn how to control the flow of my programs. For Day 3, I will focus on Conditionals (if, elif, else) and Loops (for, while).
