# Day 4 â€“ Month1_CoreFoundations / Week1_Python

## âœ… What I Learned
-  Today's entire focus was on Functions, which are the fundamental building blocks for creating organized, reusable, and readable code.

Defining and Calling: I learned the def syntax to create a function and how to execute it by calling its name.

Arguments and Parameters: I practiced passing information into functions as arguments, including setting default values for optional parameters.

Return Values: I learned how to use the return statement to send a value back from a function so it can be stored in a variable or used in other parts of the code.

Modularity: I saw how to break down a complex problem into smaller pieces by having one function call another helper function.

## ðŸ”¨ What I Built
- I created several functions to practice the core concepts. The main project was a Leap Year Calculator. This involved two functions working together: one to check if a year is a leap year (is_leap) and another that used that information to determine the correct number of days in a given month (days_in_month).

## ðŸ“‚ Code
- All the code and examples for today's session are located in the exercises.py file inside the Day004 folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Step
- Now that I know how to create my own reusable tools (functions), the next step is to learn how to use the vast library of tools that come pre-built with Python. For Day 5, the focus will be on Modules and the Python Standard Library.
