# Day 1 â€“ Month1_CoreFoundations / Week1_Python

## âœ… What I Learned
- Today I built a strong foundation in Python basics. I covered three main areas:

Variables: How to store different types of information.

Strings: How to manipulate text. I learned about indexing, slicing, changing case (.upper(), .lower()), finding substrings (.find()), and replacing text (.replace()).

Numbers: How to work with integers and floats, and perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and exponents (**). I also learned how to convert strings to numbers using int().

## ðŸ”¨ What I Built
- I built a series of small programs and exercises in a single Python script. The main focus was on practicing string operations. I wrote code to format greetings, calculate string lengths, and combine different strings using concatenation and f-strings.

## ðŸ“‚ Code
- The code for today's exercises is located in the exercises.py file in the Day001 folder. It includes practical examples for all the concepts I learned.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Step
- For Day 2, I will dive into Python's core data structures. The plan is to learn about Lists and Dictionaries, as they are essential for storing and organizing collections of data in AI and machine learning.
