# Day 3 â€“ Month1_CoreFoundations / Week1_Python

## âœ… What I Learned
- Today's focus was on control flow, which is how programs make decisions and repeat actions.

Conditional Statements: I learned how to use if, elif, and else to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

Operators: I practiced with comparison operators (==, !=, >) and logical operators (and) to create more complex conditions.

Loops: I worked with both for loops to iterate over items in a sequence (like a list) and while loops to repeat a task as long as a certain condition remains true.

## ðŸ”¨ What I Built
- I created a script with several small examples to practice these concepts. The main practical application was an odd-or-even number checker that took user input and used a conditional statement to provide a result.

## ðŸ“‚ Code
- All the code examples for today's session are located in the exercises.py file inside the Day003 folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Step
- Now that I can control the flow of my scripts, the next logical step is to learn how to organize my code into reusable blocks. For Day 4, the focus will be on Functions.
