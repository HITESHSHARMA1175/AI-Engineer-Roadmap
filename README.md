# 🚀 My 4-Month AI Engineer Journey  

Welcome to my journey of becoming an **AI Engineer** in just **4 months (4 hrs/day)**.  
I’ll be documenting my daily progress here with code, notes, and projects.  

---

## ✨ Why I’m Doing This
I want to build a strong foundation in **AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and GenAI** while also learning **MLOps & deployment**.  
This repo will keep me accountable, showcase my progress, and serve as a portfolio for future opportunities.
